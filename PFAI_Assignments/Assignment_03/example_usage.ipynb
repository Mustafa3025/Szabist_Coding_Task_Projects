    "\n",
    "## Use Case Analysis: Image Compression and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code demonstrates the use of a custom library `ai_matrix_ops` for performing various linear algebra operations on an example grayscale image represented as a matrix. The primary objectives of this use case are image compression and analysis using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and other linear algebra operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Compressed Image\n",
    "- **Purpose**: The purpose of this operation is to compress the image matrix by reducing its dimensions while preserving important information.\n",
    "- **Approach**: SVD is performed on the image matrix, and the singular value matrix and left and right singular vectors are truncated to retain only a subset of singular values and vectors. The compressed image is reconstructed using the truncated matrices.\n",
    "- **Implementation**: This is achieved by using the `matrix_decomposition` function to obtain the singular value decomposition of the image matrix, and then performing matrix multiplication operations to reconstruct the compressed image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Pseudo-Inverse Matrix\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Calculating the pseudo-inverse of the image matrix is useful for various image processing tasks, such as image restoration and solving linear least squares problems.\n",
    "- **Approach**: The pseudo-inverse is obtained by taking the reciprocal of non-zero singular values and performing matrix multiplication operations on the truncated singular vectors and singular value matrix.\n",
    "- **Implementation**: This operation involves using the `matrix_decomposition` function to obtain the SVD of the image matrix and then performing matrix multiplication operations to compute the pseudo-inverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Image Determinant\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Calculating the determinant of the image matrix provides information about the volume scaling factor of the linear transformation represented by the matrix.\n",
    "- **Approach**: The determinant of the image matrix is directly computed using the `matrix_determinant` function.\n",
    "- **Implementation**: This operation involves calling the `matrix_determinant` function with the image matrix as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Optimal Threshold for Compression\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Determining the optimal threshold for compression is crucial for balancing between image quality and compression ratio.\n",
    "- **Approach**: The optimal threshold is set as half of the rank of the image matrix.\n",
    "- **Implementation**: This operation involves calling the `matrix_rank` function to determine the rank of the image matrix and then computing the optimal threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Singular Values and Image Rank\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Obtaining the singular values and rank of the image matrix provides insights into its structure and properties.\n",
    "- **Approach**: The singular values are obtained using the `matrix_decomposition` function, and the rank is determined using the `matrix_rank` function.\n",
    "- **Implementation**: These operations involve calling the `matrix_decomposition` and `matrix_rank` functions with the image matrix as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Image Norm\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Calculating the norm of the image matrix helps in quantifying its magnitude and behavior under compression.\n",
    "- **Approach**: The 2-norm (largest singular value) of the image matrix is computed.\n",
    "- **Implementation**: This operation involves calling the `matrix_norm_calculation_2_norm` function with the image matrix as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "The provided code demonstrates the usage of linear algebra operations for image compression and analysis. By leveraging SVD and other matrix operations, it achieves tasks such as compression, pseudo-inverse calculation, determinant computation, rank determination, and norm calculation. These operations provide valuable insights into the image structure and enable effective image processing and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis provides a detailed understanding of the purpose, approach, and implementation of each operation in the given use case. It highlights the significance of linear algebra in image processing and analysis tasks."
